Maintenance and Troubleshooting
===============================

This document provides guidelines for maintaining the InfinityFit platform and resolving common issues.

Routine Maintenance
-------------------
To keep InfinityFit running smoothly, perform the following tasks regularly:

1. **Update Dependencies**:
   - Run the following command to ensure all packages are up-to-date:
     ```
     pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Monitor Server Logs**:
   - Check application logs for warnings or errors:
     ```
     tail -f logs/app.log
     ```
   - Investigate and resolve any critical errors promptly.

3. **Database Optimization**:
   - Regularly back up the database to prevent data loss:
     ```
     pg_dump infinityfit_db > backup_$(date +%F).sql
     ```
   - Run database optimization commands to improve performance:
     ```
     VACUUM FULL;
     ```

4. **Security Patches**:
   - Check for updates to libraries and dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
   - Regularly review security settings in the `config.yaml` file.

Troubleshooting Guide
---------------------
Follow these steps to diagnose and resolve common issues:

1. **Application Fails to Start**:
   - Check the configuration file (`config.yaml`) for missing or incorrect settings.
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set:
     ```
     export DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
     export SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     ```

2. **Slow Performance**:
   - Confirm the server has sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, disk space).
   - Use a performance profiler to identify bottlenecks in the code.

3. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure the database server is running:
     ```
     systemctl status postgresql
     ```
   - Check if the database URL in `config.yaml` is correct.

4. **User Unable to Login**:
   - Verify the user exists in the database:
     ```
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='sohee2125@gmail.com';
     ```
   - Reset the password if necessary:
     ```
     UPDATE users SET password='new_hashed_password' WHERE email='sohee2125@gmail.com';
     ```

Backup and Recovery
-------------------
1. **Backup the Database**:
   - Run the following command to create a backup:
     ```
     pg_dump infinityfit_db > backup.sql
     ```

2. **Restore from Backup**:
   - Use the following command to restore the database:
     ```
     psql infinityfit_db < backup.sql
     ```

3. **Application Files Backup**:
   - Ensure all configuration files (`config.yaml`, `.env`) are included in the backup.
